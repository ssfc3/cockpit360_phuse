        <h2>Welcome to Cockpit 360</h2>
        <p>Cockpit360 is what local businesses and private dental, medical, and legal practices use to benchmark financial performance (e.g. sales growth, profitability) to peers.  
        <h3>How We See the World</h3>
        <p>Here's how the world works... big companies have the advantage of big budgets for functional specialists (e.g. marketing, sales, human resources, technology, etc.) and armies of consultants to help with everything from minimizing tax burdens to growing revenue and fostering innovation ... and smaller-sized businesses don't - plain and simple.  We’re changing this paradigm.</p>
        <p>Simply put, we endeavor to give you the advantage traditionally reserved for big companies.  And it begins with providing an effective way for you to benchmark the performance and health of your business in a way that is practical and personal.  </p>
        <p>In the end, our goal is to make this platform will help your business to compete, adapt, and perform better!</p>
        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Cockpit360 was founded on the belief that local businesses are the true backbone of the economy, the glue of our communities and a source of immense pride for owners and their families.  In fact, Cockpit360’s founder, Stan, is no stranger to the ups and downs experienced by local business.  His father launched his first business while Stan was 3 years old and went on to launch 6 more businesses over his 27 year career.  Through this experience, Stan learned of the tremendous burden experienced by business owners who often lacked the tools and expertise required to gauge performance and improve it.  His father likened the feeling of not being able to effectively benchmark his businesses to the sensation pilots must have when flying with ZERO visibility.  Professionally, Stan launched a successful career at a top business consulting Firm.  Over his career, he accumulated over 15,000 hours of experience helping Fortune 500 companies improve performance.  Together, these personal and professional experiences shaped Stan’s vision – revolutionizing the way local businesses perform!</p>
        <h3>The Difference</h3>
        <p>Cockpit360 eliminates the time, expense, and complexity involved with benchmarking business performance.  Cockpit360 is the big idea whose time has come.  We’re different from any other company, and proud of the factors that set us apart:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our Passion – Cockpit360 was born out of a personal and powerful experience.  Our founder's story serves as the passion and vision behind Cockpit360.</li>
            <li>Our Focus – Our focus is comprised of local businesses and practices with less than $15 million in annual revenue.  We do not serve Fortune 500 companies, because we figure they already have all the help they need.</li>
            <li>Our Value – We don’t see anything "small" about small business.  This is why we prefer "local business" over "small business"; because we don’t see anything "small" about someone’s living dream or a family’s livelihood – that’s how we see it.</li>
        </ul>
